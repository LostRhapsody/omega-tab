## Aesthetic

**"Minimal Terminal"** — The design is inspired by command-line interfaces and classic terminal aesthetics, but rendered with modern polish:

1. **Monochromatic foundation** — Nearly all UI is grayscale (cream whites, soft grays, deep blacks), creating a calm, paper-like reading experience

2. **Single bold accent** — The vibrant mint green (`#06d6a0`) is used sparingly for focus states, indicators, and interactive elements—like a terminal cursor or LED light

3. **Retro-tech details** — Features like LED pulse animations, cursor blink effects, and ticker transitions evoke CRT monitors and old-school computing

4. **High contrast, low noise** — Strong text/background contrast for readability, minimal decorative elements, generous whitespace

5. **Warm undertones** — The off-white background (`#f8f7f4`) has a subtle cream/paper warmth rather than stark clinical white

The vibe is: **"What if a beautifully typeset newspaper met a 1980s terminal?"**
