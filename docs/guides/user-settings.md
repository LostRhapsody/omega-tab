To access your user settings:

1. Click on the user icon in the top right corner of the dashboard
2. Click on the Settings cog icon ⚙️ in the dropdown

## Available Settings

OmegaTab offers the following user preferences:

- **Enable Search History**: When enabled, OmegaTab will remember your recent searches for quick access. History is stored locally and never leaves your PC.
- **Open Links In New Tabs**: When enabled, clicking on links will open them in a new browser tab rather than the current tab
- **Enable Autosuggest (Powered By Brave)**: Shows search suggestions as you type, powered by Brave's search API
- **Fetch Metadata for new links**: Automatically retrieves titles, descriptions, and icons from websites when you add new links

::: warning Brave Search API
This is temporarily disabled and will require manual setup. We'd like to smooth out the experience before rolling this out.
